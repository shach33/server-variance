client.c , client_old.c
-----------------------

Macros: 
REQRATE: Target Request Rate(Number of requests per second per connection)
DURATION: Time in seconds to run the experiment
NUM_REQS: Number of request parameters(arrival time and servie time) to pregenerate. Generate twice the number required for the duration with uniform inter arrival time. 
IAT: Mean inter arrival time for requests
NUMFILES: Number of files to write the pre generated parameters to. This is done to decrease the overhead of keeping a large file open.

1. Generate inter arrival times with mean IAT
2. Generate service times with pareto distribution. Mean and alpha values are apecified in main().
3. The connection is established. 
4. Each request contains its service time in payload.
4. Each request waits for the previous one to complete before transmission. At one time, there is only one inflight request. 



Server.c
--------

1. The server waits for a request. 
2. It reads the payload.
3. For FCFS workload, it busy loops for specified service time and a reply is sent afterwards.
