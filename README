Server Variance

The response time of a request includes serving time and waiting time. 
Serving time is the time when the 
request is being actively worked upon, in order to generate a response.
Waiting time is the time the requesnts spends in the queue, waiting to be served.

In addition to mean service time, the variability of the service time is also 
a factor to reduce response time. 

Through this project, I worked on the initial idea to explore the alternative 
approach of reducing variability in service time as a means to reduce response 
time, even if doing so increases the mean service time.
